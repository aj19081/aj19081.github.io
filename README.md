# 2021-3DBuilding
when it comes to finding rooms in different buildings, there are always many difficulities.
The client has been working in the university for almost 30 years and still get lost sometimes for finding meeting rooms.
this lead us to an aim that find out an application which is capable of finding any room of the building when we put in its room number, and give out a perfect path from user's 
location to that room. 
In this project
1.a 3D model is required to show user the overview of the building and pathes.
2.a path finding algorithm is required to find out the shortest path
3.users should be able to touch the screen to input the room number they intend to go to.
